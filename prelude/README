These go in /etc/prelude-lml/rules

You'll then need to modify the following files with the following bits:

/etc/prelude-lml/prelude-lml.conf:

[format=bro]
time-format = "%S"
prefix-regex = "^(?P<timestamp>.{10})"
file = /data/bro-cluster/logs/current/notice.log


/etc/prelude-lml/ruleset/pcre.rules:

regex=ACTION_LOG;		include = bro-2.0.rules;
